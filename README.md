# F1 PHP and JS Library
The F1 library focus on simplicity, efficiency and ease of use.

## One File Per Service
Each service in F1 is encapsulated in a single file,
making it easy to locate and use. This is in contrast to 
frameworks that spread functionality across multiple files,
making it difficult to find and follow.

## Native Language Focus
F1's focus on native PHP and JS functions over third-party abstractions aligns with its 
minimalist philosophy and fully leveraging the features provided in a language instead of 
reinventing the wheel. This approach means that developers only need to know standard
PHP and JS to work on code, with no special tooling required.

## Lightweight and Modular
The F1 library is designed to be lightweight. It tries to keep files to a minimum
and code under 300 lines per file. All files are framework agnostic 
and optional, so you can pick and choose what you need.

## Performance Oriented
F1 code is written to be as efficient as possible, minimizing CPU cycles,
memory, and disk usage.

## Easy Deployment
F1 facilitates easy app deployment thanks to its minimal file structure.
It adopts convention-based practices over complex configurations,
simplifying the setup process.
